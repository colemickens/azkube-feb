Need to implement:
0. Tests
1. Need to implement: scale, destroy
2. Upfront validation of some parameters would be smart

Possibly:
1. Integrate viper for having "templates" for deployments and less cli args?
2. Roll certs? (from here? nixops ftw!)
3. "flavors" = "coreos" or "ubuntu 16.04" (I refuse to support upstart and 14.04)


adopt standard .gitignore

consider moving the template files to go with backticks so we dont have to esacpe


kube-controller-manager doesn't respect kubeconfig


node scaleset should not need to wait on the master, if we can fix this, we can probably cut down on deploy time a good deal
 - the reason it's like this is becasue sometimes the privateIp is not respected (aka, another azure bug)
