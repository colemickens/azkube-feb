Need to implement:
0. Tests
1. Need to implement: scale, destroy
2. Upfront validation of some parameters would be smart

Possibly:
1. Integrate viper for having "templates" for deployments and less cli args?
2. Roll certs? (from here? nixops ftw!)
3. "flavors" = "coreos" or "ubuntu 16.04" (I refuse to support upstart and 14.04)


adopt standard .gitignore
